## Bio
I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.math.cuhk.edu.hk/) of The Chinese University of Hong Kong, working with Professor [Renjun Duan](https://www.math.cuhk.edu.hk/~rjduan/) and [Liu Liu](https://www.math.cuhk.edu.hk/~lliu/). I'll move to the School of Mathematics at University of Minnesota, Twin Cities from this fall.

Before joining CUHK, I obtained my Ph.D. degree from [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/ma/) in 2021, where I was supervised by Professor [Tong Yang](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/ma/people/profile/yangt.htm) in Partial Differential Equations and Kinetic Theory, 
as well as working with Professor [Jingwei Hu](https://jingweihu-math.github.io/webpage/) in the numerical field of Kinetic Equations.<br>
Prior to that, I received my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from the [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/new/) in 2017, 
where my advisors were Professor [Changjiang Zhu](http://www2.scut.edu.cn/math/2017/1227/c14582a242269/page.htm) and [Huanyao Wen](http://www2.scut.edu.cn/math/2017/1227/c14582a242252/page.htm).
