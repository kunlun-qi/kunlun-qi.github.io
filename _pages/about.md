## Bio

I am currently a Dunham Jackson Assistant Professor (postdoctoral position) at the [School of Mathematics](https://cse.umn.edu/math) of [University of Minnesota-Twin Cities](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/), where my mentor is [Li Wang](https://liwang-umn.github.io/math/), and also working with [Richard James](https://cse.umn.edu/aem/richard-d-james), [Mitchell Luskin](https://cse.umn.edu/math/mitchell-luskin) and [Alex Watson](https://cse.umn.edu/math/alex-watson).

Before joining UMN in 2022, I spent one year in the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.math.cuhk.edu.hk/) of The Chinese University of Hong Kong as Postdoctoral Fellow, working with [Renjun Duan](https://www.math.cuhk.edu.hk/~rjduan/) and [Liu Liu](https://www.math.cuhk.edu.hk/~lliu/). 
Prior to CUHK, I obtained my Ph.D. degree from [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/ma/) in 2021, where I was fortunate to be supervised by [Tong Yang](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/people/academic-staff/prof-yang-tong/) in Partial Differential Equations and Kinetic Theory, as well as collaborating with [Jingwei Hu](https://jingweihu-math.github.io/webpage/) in the numerical field of Kinetic Equations. I received my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from the [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/new/) in 2017, where my advisors were [Changjiang Zhu](http://www2.scut.edu.cn/math/2017/1227/c14582a242269/page.htm) and [Huanyao Wen](http://www2.scut.edu.cn/math/2017/1227/c14582a242252/page.htm).
