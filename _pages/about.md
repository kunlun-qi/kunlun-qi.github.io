## Bio
I'm a third year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Mathemtics](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/ma/) at City Universtiy of Hong Kong, 
surpervised by [Prof. Tong Yang](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/ma/people/profile/yangt.htm) in Partial Differential Equations and Kinetic Theory, 
as well as informally advised by [Dr. Jingwei Hu](https://www.math.purdue.edu/~hu342/Site/Home.html) in the numerical field of Kinetic Equations. 
Priori to that, I obtained my Bachelor degree in Mathematics from the [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/new/) in 2017, 
where my advisors are [Prof. Changjiang Zhu](http://www2.scut.edu.cn/math/2017/1227/c14582a242269/page.htm) and [Prof. Huanyao Wen](http://www2.scut.edu.cn/math/2017/1227/c14582a242252/page.htm).
